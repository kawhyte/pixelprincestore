# Adding New Art to Free Downloads

This guide walks you through adding a new digital art print to The Pixel Prince Store using **Sanity CMS** and **cloud storage** (Cloudinary/Google Drive).

---

## Overview

Each art piece requires:
- **4 high-resolution PNG files** (4"×5", 8"×10", 16"×20", 40×50cm)
- **2 preview images** (card and detail) - uploaded to Sanity
- **1 ZIP bundle** (all sizes combined)
- **Sanity Studio entry** - all metadata managed in CMS

**Storage:**
- ✅ **Cloudinary** for files under 10MB (recommended)
- ✅ **Google Drive** for larger files
- ❌ No local file storage - everything is cloud-based

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Artwork

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Original high-resolution artwork (recommended: 6000×7500px minimum)
- 3:4 aspect ratio maintained across all sizes
- 300 DPI for print quality
- Clean, professional appearance

---

### Step 2: Export Print-Ready Files

Create 4 PNG files at these exact specifications:

#### Size 1: 4"×5" (Small)
```bash
# Dimensions: 1200 × 1500 px
# DPI: 300
# Format: PNG (lossless)
# Target size: 1-2 MB
```

#### Size 2: 8"×10" (Medium)
```bash
# Dimensions: 2400 × 3000 px
# DPI: 300
# Format: PNG (lossless)
# Target size: 2-4 MB
```

#### Size 3: 16"×20" (Large)
```bash
# Dimensions: 4800 × 6000 px
# DPI: 300
# Format: PNG (lossless)
# Target size: 7-10 MB
```

#### Size 4: 40×50cm (European)
```bash
# Dimensions: 4724 × 5906 px
# DPI: 300
# Format: PNG (lossless)
# Target size: 7-10 MB
```

**File Naming Convention:**
```
{artwork-name}-{size-id}.png

Examples:
- midnight-bloom-4x5.png
- midnight-bloom-8x10.png
- midnight-bloom-16x20.png
- midnight-bloom-40x50cm.png
```

### Step 3: Upload Files to Cloud Storage

You have two options depending on file size:

#### Option A: Cloudinary (Files < 10MB) ✅ Recommended

1. Open **Sanity Studio** at `http://localhost:3333`

3. Use the built-in **High-Res Asset Upload** for each size
4. Files are automatically uploaded to Cloudinary

**Upload Files:**
