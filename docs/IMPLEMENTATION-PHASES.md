# Free Art Downloads - Implementation Phases

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of a downloadable digital art print system with weekly limits, multiple size options, and ZIP bundles.

**Key Features:**
- Users can download **3 sizes per week** (rolling 7-day window)
- Multiple print sizes per artwork: 4"×5", 8"×10", 16"×20", 40×50cm
- Individual size downloads OR complete ZIP bundles
- Cookie-based tracking (no authentication required)
- Detail pages for each artwork with size selection
- Confetti celebrations and toast notifications
- Auto-cleanup of old download records

**Architecture Decisions:**
- **Weekly Limit**: 3 downloads per week (approved over "1 per day")
- **File Structure**: Flat with prefixes (`ethereal-dreams-4x5.png`)
- **Routing**: `/art/[id]` for detail pages
- **ZIP Generation**: Auto-generated with HOW-TO-OPEN.txt instructions
- **Preview Images**: Stored in `/public/art-previews/card/` and `/detail/`
